## üö® Production Performance Crisis - Fixed!

### Issues Identified:
1. **CSS Optimization Breaking Production** - `optimizeCss: true` was corrupting CSS bundle
2. **White Background Bug** - CSS variables not loading properly 
3. **1+ Minute Load Times** - Aggressive caching headers blocking resources
4. **Cross-browser Failures** - Over-optimized headers causing conflicts

### ‚úÖ Fixes Applied:

#### 1. **Removed Problematic Optimizations**
- Removed `optimizeCss: true` (was breaking CSS in production)
- Simplified headers to avoid caching conflicts
- Reduced aggressive performance optimizations

#### 2. **Added Critical CSS**
- Inline critical CSS in `<head>` for immediate dark theme
- Fallback colors in `globals.scss` 
- Prevents white background flash

#### 3. **Simplified Analytics**
- Reverted Google Analytics to `afterInteractive`
- Removed complex loading optimizations that were blocking

#### 4. **CSS Fallbacks**
- Added `!important` fallback colors
- Ensured dark theme loads immediately
- Protected against CSS loading failures

### üöÄ Expected Results After Deployment:

1. **Load Times**: Should drop from 1+ minute to 2-5 seconds
2. **White Backgrounds**: Fixed with critical CSS
3. **Cross-browser**: Consistent performance across all browsers
4. **FAQ Navigation**: Should load instantly instead of 30-40 second delays

### üìã Next Steps:

1. **Deploy these changes immediately**
2. **Test on external computers again** 
3. **Clear browser cache** after deployment
4. **Monitor `/debug/chrome`** for performance data

### üõ†Ô∏è If Issues Persist:

1. Check Netlify build logs for CSS errors
2. Use Chrome DevTools Network tab to identify slow resources
3. Test in incognito mode to rule out cache issues

The 1+ minute load times were caused by CSS optimization conflicts in production that don't show up in development. This should resolve all the performance and styling issues you experienced.
